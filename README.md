## 📝 What is PickLLM?

PickLLM helps users find the right large language model (LLM) for their specific use case. Instead of drowning in technical benchmarks and scattered metrics, PickLLM provides actionable recommendations tailored to your needs.

### 🎯 Why PickLLM?

**The Problem:**

- 🤯 Too many LLMs with varying size, cost, latency, and licensing
- 📊 Technical evaluation metrics that are scattered and hard to interpret
- ⚖️ Users must switch between different leaderboards when facing trade-offs among cost, latency, and intelligence
- 🔍 Users need actionable recommendations, not raw benchmark scores

**Our Solution:**

- 📝 Simple questionnaire to understand your use case
- 🧠 Smart recommendation engine powered by LLM database
- 🏆 Top 3 LLM recommendations with clear reasoning
- ⚖️ Compare models side-by-side to make the best choice

## 🚀 How It Works

- **Deployment:** Vercel, AWS/GCP/Azure

## ⚡ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- uv (for dependency management)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/PickLLM.git
cd PickLLM

# Install dependencies with uv
uv add flask python-dotenv

# Set up environment variables (optional)
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration if needed
```

### Running the Application

```bash
# Start the Flask development server
uv run python app.py

# Open your browser to http://localhost:5555
```

### Data Collection

```bash
# Collect the latest LLM leaderboard data
python collect_leaderboard_data.py

# This will create CSV files in the data/ directory with current rankings
```

## 📊 Data

PickLLM's recommendations are powered by real-time data from the **LMArena Leaderboard**, one of the most comprehensive and trusted sources for LLM performance evaluation.

### 🏟️ LMArena Dataset

**What is LMArena?**
LMArena is a crowdsourced platform where users compare LLM responses side-by-side in real conversations. Unlike synthetic benchmarks, LMArena captures real-world performance through human preference data.

**Data Dimensions:**
- 📝 Text - General conversation and text generation (258+ models)
- 👁️ Vision - Multimodal visual understanding (87+ models)
- 🖼️ Image - Image generation and editing (18+ models)
- ✏️ Image-Edit - Advanced image manipulation capabilities
- 🌐 WebDev - Web development and coding assistance

**Key Metrics:**
- Arena Score - Elo rating from head-to-head comparisons
- Confidence Intervals - Statistical reliability of rankings
- Vote Count - Number of human evaluations
- Model Metadata - Organization, license, knowledge cutoff

**Why LMArena?**
1. Human-Centric - Based on real user preferences, not synthetic tests
2. Comprehensive - Covers multiple modalities and use cases
3. Transparent - Open methodology and continuous updates
4. Battle-Tested - Millions of comparisons from diverse users worldwide

This rich, real-world dataset enables PickLLM to provide recommendations that truly reflect how models perform in practice, not just in laboratory conditions.
